# Task
Compare a selection of libraries on manipulation (multiplication, addition, inverse) of large matrices ( >10,000x10,000). 
A) The comparison should show the average time needed for carrying out each of the three basic operations. 
B) The result of the operations should be verified too (for instance against each other).
C) Provide plots that show the average time (or FLOPS) needed for each operation versus the size of the matrix per library (start form 1,000x1,000 and increment toward 10,000x10,000 (1,000, 2,000, 3,000, ..., 10,000).
D) Compare against OpenCL C++
